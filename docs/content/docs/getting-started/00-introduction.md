##### Introduction

The best way to understand what kitchen does is to see it in action so we're going to use it to help us write a simple Chef cookbook. This cookbook will be complete with tests that verify the cookbook does what it's supposed to do. Kitchen comes at the process of software development with an approach that embraces the idea that writing the tests *first*, watching them fail, and then writing the code to make them pass is a great way to go.  Also known as *red, green, refactor*, it's a great way to write quality software.  By the end of this guide, you'll be familiar with this approach.

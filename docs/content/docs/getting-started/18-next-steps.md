##### Next Steps

This concludes the getting started guide for kitchen. Hopefully you are now more comfortable with Kitchen's basic usage, fundamental concepts, and a feel for a testing workflow.

From here, there are a few resources that can help you along your infrastructure testing journey:

* Jump in the `#test-kitchen` channel on [Chef Community Slack](http://community-slack.chef.io/)
* Check out the [test-kitchen repo](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen) on GitHub
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues)
* Write a blog post describing getting started with kitchen, or an interesting problem kitchen has allowed you to solve

Everyone can contribute to making kitchen better, including the documentation. If you've learned something and want to contribute, please [fork the docs](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-docs) and open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)!
